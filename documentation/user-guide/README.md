## Create Data

<img src="images/dashboard-create-data.png" height="60%" width="60%" />

After successful login, user will be redirected to this page by default in the Simple Data Exchanger application.

On loading of this page, list of available submodels will be fetched dynamically and we can select any submodel to generate the table or json of that selected submodel based on the schema provided by backend API. 

This dynamic UI implementation allows the flexibillity to support and manage multiple submodels in single SDE application and also eliminates the need of hard coded react components for the individual submodels.

There are 3 data providing options in SDE i.e. CSV Upload, Tabular Upload and JSON upload.
The top level Select submodel dropdown will be common for all of 3 tabs i.e. Upload File, Table, JSON.

This Create Data page combines all the Data provider options like 

- ### Upload File

<img src="images/sde-upload-file.png" height="60%" width="60%" />

You can upload CSV files of various supported Submodels.

At the moment, Simple Data Exchanger supports data proving options for below list of submodels,

- Serial Part Typization.
- Assembly Part Relationship.
- Batch.
- Part As Planned.
- Single Level Bom As Planned.
- Part Site Information As Planned.

You can click on the button "Choose a file" and select the proper CSV file present in your file system or you can just drag and drop your file in the drop area under upload file component.

<img src="images/sde-configure-policy.png" height="60%" width="60%" />

After successful file upload of the supported file format i.e. CSV, the button "NEXT STEP - CONFIGURE POLICIES" will be enabled and after clicking on the same, Policy selection dialog will be shown where we need to configure Access and Usage policy. 

Access policy can either be unrestricted or restricted to some Business Partner Numbers. The default company BPN number will be present by default in the list and can not be deleted when we selected Restricted Access Policy option. We can add BPN numbers by entering number and clicking on Add button.

There are 4 types of Usage Policies we can configure namely Duration, Purpose, Role and Custom Restriction.
For every usage policy we have restricted and unrestricted options.
If we selected Restricted option for any usage policy, then we need to enter respective valid free text value.

Once configuring both the policies, we need to click on "SUBMIT" button and wait for upload to finish.
This is the process of creating new data offer through SDE application by uploading CSV file.
